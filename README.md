# Able Support Chatbot

A simple chatbot that answers frequently asked questions about Able, powered by LangChain and OpenAI's API.

## Overview

This chatbot uses web scraping to gather information about Able from their website, processes that data, and uses LangChain with OpenAI's API to generate accurate responses to user queries about the company.

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### Ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- An OpenAI API key

### 1. Clone this repository

### 2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## ðŸ§  Prepare the Knowledge Base

This step scrapes Ableâ€™s website, processes the text, and builds semantic vector embeddings.

### 4. Run the scraper to collect data (if needed):
```
python -m src.scraper
python -m src.data_processor
python -m src.embeddings
```

## ðŸš€ Launch the Chatbot

### 5. Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser and go to:
